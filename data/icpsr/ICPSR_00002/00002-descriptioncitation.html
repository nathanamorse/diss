		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This data collection provides the names of candidates,
political party name and ICPSR party ID code, and the number of votes
received by each candidate in the constituency for elections between
1788 and 1990. The data include county-level returns for over 90
percent of all elections to the offices of president, governor, United
States representative (1824-1990), and United States senator
(1912-1990). The dataset also includes returns for approximately
two-thirds of all elections to the offices of president, governor, and
United States representative for the period 1788-1823. Returns for one
additional statewide office are included beginning with the 1968
elections. Also presented are 1990 data from the District of Columbia
election for United States senator and United States representative.
The offices of two senators and one representative were created by the
"District of Columbia Statehood Constitutional Convention
Initiative," which was approved by District voters in 1980. Elections
for these offices were postponed until the 1990 general election. The
three offices are currently local District positions, which will turn
into federal offices if the District becomes a state.</span></p>
