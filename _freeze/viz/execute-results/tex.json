Now that the distribution of academic journals has shifted from print to web, some of the basic norms for formatting content are due for reevaluation. In particular, there is no longer a need to optimize figures for print. Even though a small fraction of an article's readers may print it to read and annotate the text, those readers can refer to the digital versions for figures that are less printer-friendly. Catering to the few people who will go to the trouble of printing a PDF or acquiring a physical journal volume comes at a large opportunity cost: content designed for screens can be much more informative and effective than printer-friendly content. Modern data visualizations---especially interactive charts, animated graphs, colorful infographics, and other screen-optimized figures[^viz-1]---are the most powerful tools at scientists' disposal for communicating ideas among themselves and (more importantly) to the public.\n\n[^viz-1]: I define *screen-optimized* figures as visualizations that cannot be adequately displayed in a grayscale hardcopy due to interactivity, animation, or color. My primary focus is interactivity. An *interactive* chart is a figure that can respond to user input (e.g., displaying a tooltip with extra information upon hovering over a point, adding a series when the user selects it in the legend, zooming the scales in or out). *Animated* charts include GIFs and video files with a plot that changes as it loops through time.\n\nI outline the benefits of interactive figures at length in @sec-viz-power, followed by a discussion of their limitations in @sec-viz-limitations. @sec-viz-methods explores various types of screen-optimized figures and offers tips on how to incorporate them into academic research. @sec-viz-interviz introduces an `R` package that produces interactive dashboards for regression models that can serve as web appendices for academic publications. The final section includes some concluding remarks.\n\n### Benefits of interactive charts {#sec-viz-benefits}\n\nBelow, I identify five main benefits that screen-optimized figures (particularly interactive charts) have over static, printer-friendly charts. The first three generally describe how screen-optimized figures help researchers convey information to the public while the last two relate more to researchers conveying information among themselves.\n\n***Accessibility*****.** Experts of any subject---everything from waiting on tables to macroeconomic trade policy---naturally use jargon and references with each other that no one else understands, which can be difficult to translate for others. Graphics, though, are more universal than text. A picture really is worth a thousand words, and a carefully designed infographic can be worth even more. Consider @fig-pol-inc again. This chart conveys however much information a reader wants to get out of it. A layperson can glance at the default configuration and learn something from it; a person with moderate expertise can try out different configurations to learn general patterns; an expert can look more closely at the numbers to discover complex patterns.\n\n***Readability*****.** @fig-pol-inc is easier to read than static printer-friendly graphs such as @fig-metrics because of its use of color to distinguish series (as opposed to line dashing or shapes), the vertical line that follows the mouse upon hovering, and the isolation of each series upon hovering over its legend label. Interactive charts can also let readers zoom in to a shorter timespan, hover over points to see their values, change the text size, swap the color scheme, and a range of other options.\n\n***Visual appeal*****.** Graphics that are optimized for screens rather than print by making use of colors, interactivity, and animations are more aesthetically pleasing, which helps them capture the attention of a wider audience. Studies have found that people pay more attention to aesthetically pleasing visualizations, understand the information more accurately, and are more easily persuaded compared to less aesthetically pleasing visualizations [@cawthon2007; @pandey2014].\n\n***Reproducibility*****.** Replication data can be easily downloaded from interactive charts. In @fig-pol-inc the menu button in the upper-right includes several options for downloading or viewing the data. Accessing the data for a particular graph takes many more steps when it is only available in a data repository or author website. Plus, the tooltip box that appears as the reader hovers over the graph also displays the data for quick investigation. In static figures, data labels can be displayed above each point, but this clutters the graph with data labels.\n\n***Transparency*****.** Alternative measures for each concept in a graph can be included and hidden by default, letting readers examine robustness without the need for cluttered plots, multiple plots, or extensive appendices. This allows readers to critically examine the author's choice of measures with the click of a button. The quick access to the data discussed in the previous paragraph makes the research even more transparent by reducing the steps needed to examine replication data.\n\nInteractivity lets authors pack an order of magnitude more information in a chart compared to a static chart while making it accessible to an order of magnitude more readers. It broadens the audience that can read it, displays the information more effectively, and encourages researchers to be more open and clear about how they conducted their analysis.\n\n### Web-based publications and appendices\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of academic books (especially textbooks and methods guides) have been published with free online versions, often produced by tools such as Bookdown or Quarto.[^viz-2] Online versions provide many of the same benefits as individual graphics discussed in the previous section, and then some. I argue that scholars should follow this model for all published research. Furthermore, online versions or visualizations should be considered the final product of the research, leaving the published printer-friendly versions to serve a more supplementary purpose.\n\n[^viz-2]: Examples include [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@wickham2017] and [*Causal Inference: The Mixtape*](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) [@cunningham2021].\n\n***Accessibility*****.** Online versions of publications can include many features that make them easier to read and more accessible to a wider audience. For example, text can be translated to other languages easily by browser extensions or buttons included in the page. Many webpages also include buttons for adjusting the text size, font, and color scheme to help readers with visual impairments. Modern webpages are usually responsive to screen size, so they can fit phones and tablets without the need for back-and-forth horizontal scrolling. Finally, webpages can include interactive graphics, which lets them harness all the accessibility benefits mentioned in @sec-viz-benefits as well.\n\n***Interactivity*****.** Digital working papers (such as the HTML version of this dissertation) often include many interactive features that aid the reader's experience. The table of contents can include links that jump the user straight to any section. Links can be included throughout the document, too, which jump the reader to figures (such as @fig-pol-inc) or sections (such as @sec-viz-benefits). Webpages can also be set so that the reader can read a footnote upon hovering over its superscript number in the text, and full citations can be viewed by hovering or clicking on in-text citations. Cited sources can then be viewed with a simple click. Lastly, collapsible blocks can display supplementary content directly in the article rather than in appendices to minimize disruption to the flow of reading.\n\n::: {.callout-note .column-margin collapse=\"true\"}\n### Example of collapsible content\n\nSupplementary material for online publications can be displayed in collapsible boxes like this instead of (or in addition to) appendices at the end of the publication. This box is called a [callout block](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html), and it is easy to implement in programs such as Quarto (which was used to produce to this dissertation).\n:::\n\n***Reproducibility*****.** Webpages can include built-in replication code throughout the text. Authors can leave code hidden by default and enable readers to show any chunk of code by clicking a button.[^viz-3] Code chunks can be placed wherever they are relevant---data preparation when the data sources are introduced, model fitting when the methods are described, and any coding for visualizations by each figure. Following this practice, any working paper with built-in code is a pedagogical resource with applied examples of methods that would interest many readers. A reader who is curious about which function an author used to achieve a task or how the author customized a plot can simply toggle the relevant code chunk rather than obtaining separate replication files, which may not be publicly available or neatly laid out.\n\n[^viz-3]: This functionality is known as *code folding*, and it is easy to implement in Rmarkdown, Quarto, Jupyter, and similar programs.\n\n***Transparency*****.** Including collapsed replication code within working papers drastically increases the chances that the code will be seen by others. That, in turn, makes it easier for readers to spot errors, discourages p-hacking, encourages authors to keep their code user-friendly, and therefore improves accountability. Furthermore, web-based working papers can include interactive charts, bringing all the same transparency benefits discussed in @sec-viz-benefits.\n\n***Customizability*****.** Authors often produce PDF versions of their working papers with LaTeX, which can be frustrating to learn for beginners. While programs like Rmarkdown, Quarto, and Jupyter can produce both PDFs with LaTeX and webpages with HTML and CSS, any advanced formatting beyond the default settings does require some basic knowledge of the respective markup languages. Simple tasks such as adjusting the font size of captions or the spacing between lines are clean and straightforward with CSS, whereas they often require packages with odd names and syntax in LaTeX. Reference guides are also much more common and user-friendly for HTML and CSS---a Google search for \"html tutorial\" returns 8 billion results while a search for \"latex tutorial\" returns a mere 43 million. Webpages are more powerful *and* easier to customize than LaTeX-generated PDFs.\n\n***Versatility*****.** HTML pages can be printed, but PDFs cannot be interactive. The fact that PDFs can only hold static content while webpages can hold both static and interactive content speaks further to the utility of screen versions of articles. Webpages can be printed and saved as PDFs, but PDFs cannot be turned into interactive webpages.\n\n## Current limitations {#sec-viz-limitations}\n\nOne of the clearest limitations of using interactive media to present academic scholarship is that it is not as permanent as print media. A variety of issues can arise that researchers must take into account when producing web-based publications and interactive media.\n\n***Discontinued software.*** For starters, interactive content is built on technology that is not guaranteed to work in the future. Adobe Flash Player, for example, was once a nearly universal plugin that powered games, animations, and other content for hundreds of millions of users. Despite its ubiquity, the software was retired in 2020, rendering all Flash content unusable unless it was manually converted to a newer format [@fiadotau2020]. Any software or package powering interactive content could someday become obsolete no matter how widely used it is, whereas static figures can last indefinitely into the future.\n\n***Third-party web hosting.*** Journals and book publishers do not usually accept interactive content, so any interactive content that authors wish to be included with a publication would have to be hosted on third-party websites as supplementary material. This presents several problems: first, even if the software powering the interactive content is supported far into the future, the website on which the material is hosted could be taken down anytime. Second, the individual page or document could be removed. Third, the URL could change, making it difficult for readers of the print article to access the online material. Unavailability of online supplementary materials is a common problem across disciplines, and over-reliance on it could make scientific research more difficult to access [@gertler2017; @evangelou2005; @schaffer2004; @williams2016].\n\n***Modifications after publication.*** Material hosted on a third-party website can be edited by the author without proper documentation. Authors could manipulate their work without updating the date of last modification to erase evidence of errors.[^viz-4] Even if an author modifies online material with good intentions, failure to include previous versions or at least indicate that the material has been modified can confuse readers who are reading a publication that references an earlier version of the online material.[^viz-5] Situations like these could erode trust both within the scientific community and between it and the public.\n\n[^viz-4]: Consider a scenario where an author posts a bar graph with a misleading scale in an online appendix. The graph gives the appearance that there is a much greater distance between the two bars than there really is. After critics on social media point out the problematic scale, the author updates the appendix with a corrected graph. However, the appendix keeps the original date and has no indication that it has been modified. The author then accuses their critics of doctoring screenshots of the graph for the sake of discrediting the author.\n\n[^viz-5]: Imagine that an author posts a set of regression models in an online appendix, one of which another author references in a later article. After these articles are published, the author re-fits the models with slightly different data and finds consistent results for their variables of interest, so they update their online appendix. However, the estimates for the variables cited in the later article have reversed from positive to negative. The online appendix has no indication of modification, so future readers are confused and assume that the second author misinterpreted the results.\n\n### Recommendations for using online academic media\n\nThese limitations do not mean scholars should avoid using interactive content and online materials; rather, these issues point to the need for careful adherence to responsible standards. I recommend the following practices for online academic media:\n\n-   **Interactive content should not be expected to last more than 10 years.** Interactive figures are not the place to store information for centuries to come. They should be geared toward communicating information to readers in the near future, not for holding knowledge permanently.[^viz-6]\n\n-   **Online content should be hosted on established repositories or personal websites.** A 2017 study found that a majority of all links to supplementary materials published in the *American Political Science Review* between 2000 and 2013 were now broken [@gertler2017]. Contrary to what one may expect, links to institutional websites were *more* likely to be broken than links to personal websites (even when hosted on institutional servers). Perhaps this is because each author is more protective of their own content than is the staff for institutions that they may not even work for anymore. Wherever online materials are hosted, authors should strive to make sure the link will work for at least 20 years, ideally more.[^viz-7]\n\n-   **All modifications of online content should be dated.** To avoid the issues mentioned earlier, any online material---appendices, digital working papers, visualizations---should clearly indicate the date it was last modified. Ideally, previous versions could be accessible too.\n\n[^viz-6]: The 10-year benchmark was chosen because Adobe Flash Player was retired around 10 years after the first major sign that it was on the decline. Flash was steadily rising with no end in sight until Steve Jobs published a letter criticizing Flash in 2010, which @fiadotau2020 called the \"beginning of the end\" for Flash. 10 years later, Adobe discontinued support for Flash.\n\n[^viz-7]: Many institutions contract with webhosting services such as CampusPress and OpenScholar so that faculty can build personal websites. These are useful platforms for posting content for the short term, but these websites are generally retired whenever the faculty member moves to a different institution. To keep content and URLs more permanent, scholars should avoid using platforms like these to host supplementary materials for their research.\n\nInteractive media may not last forever, but it is not supposed to. It helps convey information for the near future.\n\n## Methods for modern visualizations {#sec-viz-methods}\n\n\\[Paragraph introducing this section\\]\n\n### Interactive figures with `highcharter` and `plotly`\n\n\\[Brief tutorial\\]\n\n### Animated figures with `gganimate`\n\nAnother tool in the modern toolkit is animated visualizations. GIFs are underutilized by social scientists for displaying longitudinal data; time is nearly always represented by the *x*-axis in a line graph, but often it is better represented by time itself. An animated bar graph with bars growing, shrinking, and reordering as the chart loops through time is sometimes a more efficient display of time-series cross-sectional data than a large grid of small panels with individual line graphs. Scatterplots with dots moving around are effective for showing trends along two dimensions. Animated histograms and density plots can show how an entire distribution moves over time better than a single line graph plotting the mean and error bars.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-inset-right hash='viz_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-14_197b2b49f9b0a8da7460efb663648740'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-anim-examples .fig-img .column-page-inset-right}\n\n\n```{=html}\n<video playsinline autoplay muted loop><source src='https://nmorse.com/research/congress/anim_cong.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video>\n```\n\n::: {.cell hash='viz_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-15_d571730932a188f329b96e5521eec10c'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/cong1971.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAn example of an animated plot. This figure, taken from Figure 2 of my master's thesis [@morse2021], shows the ideological distributions of members of the House and the Senate based on roll-call voting. Each dot represents a member of Congress. The $x$-axis is dimension 1 of Poole and Rosenthal's [-@poole2017] DW-NOMINATE ideal points, which generally covers issues of socioeconomic welfare; the $y$-axis is dimension 2, which generally covers civil rights issues. Members representing states in the South are shown as pink regardless of party affiliation, whereas the dividing lines were only based on party affiliation. The slopes for the dividing lines were computed using linear discriminant analysis, which finds the boundary line that maximizes the separation between the two parties. In most browsers, you can right-click on the graphic and click \"Show controls\" to enable the pause button and progress bar.

It is built on `highcharter`, a general package for interactive charts. Coefficient plots produced with `interviz` allow readers to hover over points to see their corresponding values (coefficient estimates, standard errors, etc.), click on models in the legend to select which ones to display, and adjust confidence levels for error bars.[^viz-8] I plan to add functionality for readers to tweak model specifications (e.g., dropping independent variables), which will re-run the model and update the chart in real time.\n\n[^viz-8]: A rough example of what I have made so far can be found at: [http://nmorse.com/interviz/](http://nmorse.com/interviz).\n\nThis format is the next generation of reporting regression results. It combines the visual clarity of coefficient plots, the informational capacity of regression tables, and the transparency of replication files, all in a user-friendly interface that can be easily generated in `R`. My next steps for this package are: (1) expand the scope of models that are compatible with the function, (2) expand the range of plot types in the package to include other common regression-based charts that are not already built into `highcharter` (e.g., interaction plots), and (3) write vignettes outlining how to use the functions.\n\n\\[Vignette\\]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nData visualizations are the most promising means through which academics can connect with wider audiences. Social science knowledge has been growing more complex, but the media with which social scientists visualize data have remained static (literally). Now more than ever, scholars need to catch up and embrace modern data visualization methods. Yet academics have no incentive to produce more modern visualizations. Journals still force figures to fit into static PDFs, and norms still perpetuate the outdated (and harmful) idea that printer-friendly figures are better than screen-optimized figures.\n\nAcademics have a range of tools for modernizing their fields' data visualization practices. For starters, scholars can independently post web-optimized graphics related to their research on social media platforms, personal websites, and mass media websites. Any figure in a peer-reviewed publication that the author feels is being held back by print-centric restrictions could be adapted into a web-optimized version and featured in a short mass media article. Working papers can also be circulated as HTML files instead of (or in addition to) PDFs to bypass publishers and spread modern visualizations.\n\nSecond, academic departments need to place greater weight on mass media publications and standalone data visualizations in job review processes. Ultimately, publications like these should be the end goal for any research program. Most of the text in academic journals and books is dedicated to hashing out nuanced debates among scholars and documenting methodological details that most people don't need to know. Peer-reviewed publications should be treated as a means to an end; the final product of any research should be more accessible to the general public. Articles written for mass consumption with clear language and engaging visualizations oftentimes have much broader impacts than peer-reviewed articles. Publications like these should have just as much weight on CVs, if not more, as peer-reviewed publications.\n\nThird, academic publishers should gradually shift toward web-centric standards. Barely anyone uses physical copies of journal volumes anymore, so formatting and citing PDFs as if they're printed is really just make-believe for scientists. Journals need to adapt to the reality that articles are distributed online now. PDFs should be the secondary versions of articles, designed to help the minority of readers who want to print it, and HTML versions should be the official versions. Publishers can include a \"Download HTML\" link next to the \"Download PDF\" link, which downloads a version of the page with all content embedded into the file so that it can be viewed properly even without internet connection and even when external dependencies have changed. To accommodate the few readers who do not have access to the digital copy of an article, PDFs can include static versions of any interactive plots---perhaps with one or two of the most relevant configurations or frames.\n\n\\[More final thoughts\\]\n",
