If it doesn't, [click here](https://nmorse.shinyapps.io/const-design/).** This app lets users configure a constitution on the left to maximize the outcomes in the graph on the right. By default, the app is configured to the United States Constitution. Users can pick whether to use linear regression or random forests for predictions. Linear regression produces less accurate predictions but it is easier to see how the bars move upon changing constitutional features. The plot on the second tab shows variance importance measures from the random forests, and the tooltip also displays coefficients from the linear regression models. Predictions are based on a sample of more than 600 constitutions since 1789, although some data were imputed with the MICE algorithm. All data are from the most recent version of the constitution. For example, the data for the US Constitution specifies that the upper house of the legislature is directly elected (even though the Senate was not directly elected until the 17th amendment) and democracy data for the US is as of 2021.\n:::\n:::\n\nFor more than two centuries, the consensus among legal and political scholars was that short, vague constitutions are more durable than longer, more detailed constitutions [@hammons1999], a theory typically attributed to James Madison. When constitutions provide less detail and merely lay out the basic institutional framework, the political system is more flexible and stable [@przeworski1991democracy; @elazar1985constitution; @friedman1988]. The constitution can stand as a \"living constitution,\" a foundational document that leaves controversial statutory provisions to the legislative process rather than codifying them as the law of the land. In short, brevity enables flexibility, flexibility creates stability, and stability brings endurance.\n\nWhile the logic of the Madisonian theory is intuitive, the evidence has consistently shown the opposite: longer, more detailed constitutions last longer---even those that include unnecessary provisions that could just be laws. This was first observed by @hammons1999 in the context of US state constitutions; by @negretto2012 in the context of Latin American constitutions; and by @elkins2009 in the global context with all national constitutions on record. @elkins2009 offer the most comprehensive explanation: specificity encourages flexibility. Including details that lose relevance over time incentivizes political actors to perform routine maintenance on the constitution. This normalizes the amendment process so the country can adapt its constitution to the changing world. The public keeps a more critical eye for outdated provisions that could be removed and relegated to laws, which brings a more critical eye for outdated provisions of the framework as well. Additionally, clarity fosters a more universal understanding of what the constitution says, preventing contention over disagreements in interpretation.\n\nThe app at the top of the page in @fig-const-design reveals yet another surprising effect of constitutional length. Of all the features of a constitution that its authors can control, the word count of the document is one of the strongest predictors of democracy. The app lets users design their own constitution and then predicts 10 different outcomes ranging from democracy and political stability to income inequality and standard of living. The \"Analytics\" tab shows how powerful each constitutional characteristic is for predicting each outcome in a random forest algorithm. Longer constitutions are associated with stronger democratic performance. By the default settings of the app, it appears that the length of a constitution and the number of representatives relative to population are several times more powerful than any other characteristic at predicting nearly every outcome. However, this is because these are the only two predictors that are numerical; all other characteristics are categorical variables. Numerical variables are by nature much more powerful predictors than binary variables. To level the playing field when comparing predictor strength, users can select the \"Dichotomize all variables\" option in the \"Model settings\" tab. This turns the two numerical variables into binary variables, using the median as the cutoff point. Dichotomizing constitutional length only bumps it down one spot, from the top predictor of democracy to the second most powerful predictor.\n",
