In his view, imposing an immortal constitution on future generations would impede on their right to self-govern. \"The earth belongs always to the living generation,\" he wrote. \"The dead have neither powers nor rights\" [-@jefferson1789]. If a majority of the people who instituted a constitution are no longer living, then it is no longer legitimate. Jefferson suggested that all constitutions and laws should expire after 19 years, a number he arrived at by calculating that half of all voting-age citizens at the time were expected to be dead within 19 years. Using a mortality table from a contemporary historian, Jefferson calculated as follows [-@jefferson1789]:\n\n> ::: quote-orig\n> Suppose a society in which 23,994 persons are born every year, & live to the ages stated in this table. The conditions of that society will be as follows. 1st. It will consist constantly of 617,703. persons of all ages. 2ly. Of those living at any one instant of time, one half will be dead in 24. years 8. months. 3dly. 10,675 will arrive every year at the age of 21. years complete. 4ly. It will constantly have 348,417 persons of all ages above 21. years. 5ly. And the half of those of 21. years & upwards living at any one instant of time will be dead in 18. years 8. months, or say 19. years as the nearest integral number. Then 19. years is the term beyond which neither the representatives of a nation, nor even the whole nation itself assembled, can validly extend a debt.\n> :::\n>\n> ::: quote-modern\n> Let's say there's a country where 24,000 people are born per year, and they live their full life expectancy (as of the 1780s). Here's what that would mean for this country. First, it will have a constant population of around 600,000. Second, half of the people living at any given time will be dead within 24 years and 8 months. Third, 10,000 people will turn 21 years old each year. Fourth, 350,000 will always be at least 21 years old. Fifth, half of those people will be dead within 18 years and 8 months, which we'll round up to 19 years. This means that neither the government nor the public is responsible for anything that happened more than 19 years ago.\n> :::\n\nAlthough Jefferson's method and measure were peculiar, scholars in recent years have come to an eerie finding: the median lifespan of a national constitution, out of all constitutions in the world since 1789, happens to be 19 years [@elkins2009]. Was Jefferson onto something? Perhaps his ideal life expectancy matches actual life expectancies by mere coincidence, but his argument still raises some questions: do constitutions risk decaying beyond repair when they age past their prime? Or is endurance a sign that a constitution is resilient enough to withstand threats indefinitely into the future?\n\n::: {.callout-note .mt-3 collapse=\"true\"}\n## Appendix: Would Jefferson's calculation still be 19 years today?\n\nLife expectancies and voting ages have changed since the eighteenth century, so I replicated Jefferson's method to see if the time it takes for a majority of the voting-age population at any given time to die is still 19 years. Jefferson used life expectancy figures for all adults who were at least 21 years old because that was most common voting age at the time. I lowered that to 18 for the calculation here. Jefferson's method requires many assumptions---constant population, constant birth rate, and negligible immigration rates---but he intended for his calculation to be rough and hypothetical, not exact. The first four steps of Jefferson's method are no longer needed due to more widely accessible data, so we can skip to the final step. How long can we expect half of all adults living right now to live?\n\nI obtained an actuarial table from the @ssa2023, which separates out life expectancies for men and women at each age until 119. I averaged the life expectancies for all adult male Americans, weighting by population, and then did the same for adult female Americans. Assuming men and women are each half the population, I then averaged the two numbers together. This results in the average number of years that American adults are expected to have remaining. One final assumption we must make is that the average is roughly equal to the median. That would mean that the average life expectancy for all adults is the amount of time it will take for half of adults to die.\n\nAccording to this method, half of American adults living today will be dead within 30.9 years, which can be rounded up to **31 years**. In other words, if a new constitution or law were adopted today, a majority of the current electorate (which in theory is ultimately responsible for instituting it) would be gone in just over three decades, so by Jefferson's argument it would lose any claim to legitimacy by 2055. This is 65% longer than it was in Jefferson's time. If the voting age had stayed at 21, this number would be 29.5 or around 30 years, which is 58% longer than in Jefferson's time. This means that 11% of the growth in the electorate half-life is due to lowering the voting age and 89% of the growth is due to longer life expectancies.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='dead_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-17_cb9e73676a06d522b773bc4dc9110451'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load data and filter to adults\nlife = read.csv(\"data/ssa/actuarial.csv\") %>%\n  filter(age >= 18)\n\n# Average life expectancies, weighted by number of people at each age\navg_m = sum(life$life_exp_m * life$n_lives_m) / sum(life$n_lives_m)\navg_f = sum(life$life_exp_f * life$n_lives_f) / sum(life$n_lives_f)\n\n# Average the M and F life expectancies\nmean(avg_m, avg_f)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>\n:::\n\nThe United States is one of the only countries in the world that has kept the same core constitutional text for more than two centuries, and it is one of the only countries that has not amended its constitution in three decades. Even then, the most recent amendment (ratified 1992) was minor; the last significant change to the Constitution was adopted in 1971. Half a century later, around 2016, the United States began falling into its sharpest episode of democratic backsliding in its history, according to most major democracy indices [@vdem; @polity]. My theory suggests that these are connected. Constitutions that are easier to amend or replace are stronger bulwarks against threats to democracy than rigid constitutions. Periodic revisions keep the public more engaged in politics, strengthen the polity's reflexes against new forms of loopholes, and facilitate advancement away from old forms of oppression.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<style>\n  iframe {height: 640px; width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden; margin-top: 30px;}\n  @media (max-width: 853px) {iframe {height: 800px}}\n  @media (max-width: 626px) {iframe {height: 1080px}}\n  #fig-const-dem {margin: 40px 0;}\n  .column-page-inset, iframe {margin-bottom: 0;}\n</style>\n```\n\n\n::: {#fig-const-dem}\n::: column-page-inset\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://nmorse.shinyapps.io/const/\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n**The display above should take a moment to load.

My theory also predicts that constitutional revisions tend to boost participation and prevent democratic backsliding, and they can even reverse backsliding if they include public input and referendum requirements.\n\nEntrenched constitutions are at higher risk for democratic backsliding, economic inequality, and polarization. When constitutions remain largely unchanged for long periods of time, the public sees the political system in general as unchangeable, and voters lose motivation to stay engaged in politics. This, in turn, signals to elites that they face lower costs for skewing economic policy in their favor or letting elite infighting polarize the political environment. Methods: comparative study with duration models of events of democratic backsliding comparing OECD countries with entrenched vs. unentrenched constitutions. May also include models of public opinion comparing trust and engagement in the political system in countries with entrenched vs. unentrenched constitutions.\n\n## The Epidemiology of Constitutions\n\nAlthough the term *constitution* can refer to political institutions in the abstract, here I use it to refer to written texts that serve as the foundation of a country's political institutions. A constitution is different from a *regime*, which is characterized more by informal rules determining who holds power [@stein1982]. Regimes can transition without a new constitution, and constitutions can transition without a new regime.[^dead-1] Scholars have paid considerable attention to the factors affecting regime survival [@tansey2016; @wright2013; @knutsen2015; @andersen2014]. In recent years, scholars have also begun paying more attention to the factors affecting constitutional survival.\n\n[^dead-1]: For example, @geddes2014 code the Somoza regime in Nicaragua as a continuous regime despite constitutional turnover.\n\n### Constitutional Endurance and Flexibility\n\nFor more than two centuries, the consensus among legal and political scholars was that short, vague constitutions are more durable than longer, more detailed constitutions [@hammons1999], a theory typically attributed to James Madison. When constitutions provide less detail and merely lay out the basic institutional framework, the political system is more flexible and stable [@przeworski1991democracy; @elazar1985constitution; @friedman1988]. If a brief and vague provision needs to be updated, then political actors can simply reinterpret it rather than going through a tedious amendment process. The constitution can stand as a \"living constitution,\" a foundational document that leaves controversial issues to the legislative process and judicial review rather than codifying them as the law of the land. In short, brevity enables flexibility, and flexibility brings stability.\n\nWhile the logic of the Madisonian theory is intuitive, the evidence has consistently shown the opposite: longer, more detailed constitutions last longer---even those that include unnecessary provisions that could just be laws. This was first observed by @hammons1999 in the context of US state constitutions; by @negretto2012 in the context of Latin American constitutions; and by @elkins2009 [, hereafter \"EGM\"] in the global context with all national constitutions on record. Constitutions that are more amendable over time tend to endure longer than those that are not. Overall, variables that the authors of constitutions can control---especially the ease of amendment and the specificity of the document---generally have stronger effects on constitutional lifespans than exogenous variables do.\n\nEGM offer the most comprehensive explanation, part of their constitutional renegotiation theory: specificity encourages flexibility. Including details that lose relevance over time incentivizes political actors to perform routine maintenance on the constitution. The public keeps a more critical eye for outdated provisions that could be removed and relegated to laws, which brings a more critical eye for outdated provisions of the framework as well. Additionally, clarity fosters a more universal understanding of what the constitution says, preventing contention over disagreements in interpretation.\n\nThe main hole in the Madisonian theory of constitutional endurance is that brevity does not imply flexibility. Even if the particular rules and arrangements beyond the core framework of the political system are flexible, the framework itself may not be. A flawed framework that is nearly impossible to amend can easily become the very force that suppresses flexibility. On the other hand, detail normalizes the amendment process so the polity can adapt its constitution to the changing world. For the most part, the US Constitution has neither detail nor frequent amendments, yet it is the longest lasting in the world. Why does the Madisonian theory only seem to hold up for Madison's own document? EGM offer many ideas, including that the courts' power of judicial review on constitutional matters has let it take on the role of providing flexibility and specificity in the constitutional order. It is worth noting, though, that constitutional review by courts has become the global norm [@ginsburg2008], so it is unclear if judicial review can sufficiently explain the US constitution's endurance.\n\nEGM also suggest that the US Constitution has had more detail than it seems, at least at times---it initially prohibited a ban on slavery, it briefly prohibited alcohol, and it has an unusually specific procedure for executive selection---but comparatively speaking, it is still one of the most bare-bones, framework-oriented constitutions in history. Furthermore, EGM's model predicts the age of the US Constitution with surprising accuracy, considering that their theory does not seem to explain its endurance. They do not state this explicitly, but I replicated their Cox proportional hazard model as closely as possible (details are in the \\[Data and Methods\\] section) and found that the life expectancy of the US Constitution is almost exactly its current age.\n\n### Conceptualizing Constitutions\n\nConstitutions take many forms around the world---everything from loose collections of acts and precedents to rigid formal documents explicitly labeled constitutions. To account for this heterogeneity, EGM spell out a general definition that can apply to at least one text in most countries (49):\n\n> Constitutions consist of those documents that either: (1) are identified explicitly as the *Constitution, Fundamental Law*, or *Basic Law* of a country; OR (2) contain explicit provisions that establish the documents as the *highest* law, either through entrenchment or limits on future law; OR (3) define the basic pattern of authority by establishing or suspending an executive branch of government.\n\nFurthermore, EGM do not consider constitutional amendments to be replacements. They only consider a constitution to be an altogether new constitution if it is revised outside of the normal amending procedures of the preceding constitution (55). For example, EGM mention that each of South Korea's six republics effectively rewrote its constitution through formal amendment processes, which they code as a continuous constitution. This may not be appropriate for most constitutional research. Jefferson may be satisfied by South Korea's constitutional turnover despite its constitution technically remaining in place. If the only continuity in the foundational document of a country is a single thread of formal amendment processes, then models are not fully capturing the variation across constitutions and are overestimating the variation within constitutions.\n\nEven beyond amendments, constitutional orders can fundamentally shift over the course of a constitution's lifetime. @ackerman2000we argues that the US has effectively had three constitutions (not including the Articles of Confederation), with fundamental shifts after the Civil War and during the New Deal. The post--Civil War shift came with three transformative amendments, while the paradigm shift of the New Deal had no corresponding amendments. How, then, should scholars conceptualize constitutions? How are we to distinguish between amendments that effectively overhaul their constitutions and amendments that merely change minor details? How can we account for de facto revisions of political arrangements that come with no de jure revisions?\n\nIn a forthcoming review piece, @elkins2021 step back from focusing on core constitutional texts as the unit of analysis and argue that the \"small-c\" constitution is more important than the formal document. Constitutions are only the surface of political environments, and they are too heterogeneous to show consistent patterns. Indeed, this is likely why their constitutional survival models had so many odd features. The effect of specificity, for example, on a constitution's hazard for failure may invert over time as norms fill in ambiguities or retire unneeded details. Some cultures may prefer frequent constitutional turnover as insurance against legacies of oppression, while other cultures may prefer endurance as insurance against short-term whims. Scholars may need to reorient the scope of their theory and sample to particular types of constitutions at particular phases of their life cycles [@geddes2003].\n\nEven when patterns emerge, Elkins and Ginsburg are doubtful that constitutional texts have much of an effect on political outcomes. They argue that their work on the determinants of constitutional endurance still has causal validitiy because the variation in the types of constitutions around the world is precisely the variation that they sought to explain. It seems, then, that really the only universal conclusions scholars can draw about causal effects of constitutional design are how long the core texts last. But if the core texts do not matter, then the endurance of a constitution does not matter either. In the next section, I argue that constitutional endurance does matter to some degree, but not because of the text itself---rather, endurance shapes the political culture.\n\n## The Role of Constitutional Endurance in the Current Democratic Recession\n\nAlthough a long-lasting constitution can be desirable, survival is not the end goal of a constitution; it is more of a means to an end. Throughout the preambles and purpose statements of constitutions, the closest goal to survival is stability [@elkins2014], although these are not the same. Survival often indicates stability, but it can also indicate impending instability. If the framework of a political system is flawed, then the survival of its constitution can come at the cost of stability. Autocratic regimes, for example, sometimes democratize and install a new constitution when public dissatisfaction with the status quo becomes dangerously high [@huntington1991]. In these moments, lengthening the lifespan of the constitution any more would become the *cause* of instability.\n\nConstitutions are usually designed with many other goals in mind, such as security, state capacity, representativeness, economic prosperity, and civil liberties. The literature is rich with evidence that constitutional design affect these outcomes. @lederman2001 find that parliamentary systems and states with strong protections for the freedom of the press have less corruption. @lijphart1997 identifies many electoral rules that increase participation. @golder2010 find that systems with proportional representation are more representative of their constituencies than majoritarian systems. Likewise, @anderson1997 find that constituents are more satisfied with their government under proportional representation. @birchfield1998 find that constitutions calibrated toward consensus democracy have lower levels of income inequality than those calibrated toward majoritarian democracy.\n\nPerhaps the most critical outcome constitutions are geared toward is democracy. Specifically, constitutions are usually designed (in theory) to maintain the two primary dimensions of democracy identified by @dahl1971: competition and participation. Around the world, democracy has been slipping since around 2005, making the last decade and a half the first global democratic recession since the World War II era [@house2014freedom; @vdemreport]. Unlike economic recessions, which are cyclical, predictable, and relatively short, democratic recessions are a new phenomenon that are much less understood. Political science does not yet have a consensus diagnosing the causes, a general theory explaining the processes universally, or a clear solution [@waldner2018].\n\nA wide range of theories have been offered: agency-based theories suggest power-hungry presidents and political actors are to blame [@mainwaring2013]; cultural theories focus on the effects of norms and civic engagement [@putnam1993making]; institutionalists posit that certain types of electoral systems and party systems are more vulnerable [@reynolds2010designing]; political economists argue inequality and economic structures affect regime types [@boix2003]; social theories suggest ethnic divisions, class, and coalitions shape democratic outcomes [@rabushka1972politics]; and international relations theories highlight the influence of foreign actors [@levitsky2006]. The causes of democratic backsliding are likely heterogeneous around the world, so each of these six frameworks is relevant in some countries more than others. @waldner2018 point out that the \"causes of vulnerability to backsliding may be distinct from the proximate causes of particular instantiations of backsliding\" (107). Each of the factors theorized to contribute to backsliding may put countries at risk, but the specific force that ultimately triggers backsliding in a country may not be as easy to observe or explain systematically.\n\nOne undertheorized factor in this realm is constitutions, precisely because of the problems discussed earlier. Additionally, the consequences of constitutions on democracy may be confounded by the forces that shape constitutions in the first place. Norms and culture, for example, have been found to have wide-ranging effects on unwritten constitutional practices, and thus on constitutional performance [@wiener2008]. Many scholars argue that the written constitution is merely a symbol, a reflection of political norms. Yet a constitution's symbolic role is precisely where its effects may be found.\n\nConstitutions are the most tangible symbols nations have for their political systems. Cultures can develop around them, especially around specific provisions. In the United States, for example, an entire subculture has developed against gun regulation, hailing the Second Amendment as its source of authority. The text of the provision matters less than its symbolism---the second word of the text is \"well-regulated\"---since its mere presence gives legitimacy to the movement. Perhaps if the Bill of Rights explicitly mentioned the right to vote, that same subculture might hold voting rights just as preciously. Constitutions serve as reference points on which the public views the political system at large.\n\nWhen constitutions stagnate, the public is likely to view the unwritten constitution as stagnating as well. The symbol of the political system appears immutable and unshakeable, so the system itself must be. Nationwide cynicism over the political system can more easily flourish, and political participation decreases. This, in turn, signals to elites that they face lower costs for corruption, as the size of the selectorate decreases [@de2005logic]. In contrast, when constitutions undergo revisions at a healthier pace, the prospect for change is within closer reach. Amendments allow the public to correct for loopholes where there is a disconnect between enumerated rules and contemporary norms, which raises the costs of corruption and violating norms even further for elites. The effects of constitutional revisions are likely more pronounced for countries with more inclusive constitutional revision processes---those with democratically selected conventions, public referenda, or other mechanisms of including the public in the process.\n\n> **Hypothesis 1.** Controlling for environment, countries are at higher risk for democratic backsliding when their constitutions remain unchanged longer than predicted.\n>\n> **Hypothesis 2.** During periods of democratic backsliding, inclusive constitutional revision processes tend to reverse backsliding while elite-controlled constitutional revision processes tend to exacerbate it.\n\nOverall, my theory suggests that the link between frequent amendments and instability, associated with the Madisonian theory of constitutional endurance, is merely a correlation. When accounting for design, history, and environment, constitutional revisions generally help countries that are relatively stable by normalizing adaptations to the changing environment.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='dead_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-18_004a35d442a27b8bbe583bebdd3e601b'}\n\n:::\n\n```{=html}\n<script>\n  // Initialize tooltips\n  const tooltipTriggerList = document.querySelectorAll('[data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\"]')\n  const tooltipList = [...tooltipTriggerList].map(tooltipTriggerEl => new bootstrap.Tooltip(tooltipTriggerEl))\n</script>\n```\n",
