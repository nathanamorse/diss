This dissertation offers an introduction to the insights that can be gleaned from comparative politics. Every society is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all constitution that could optimize outcomes in any scenario. Instead, each constitution has to be tailored for the individual needs and goals of its constituents. Now that we have centuries' worth of data on the effects of different choices in different contexts, learning about these patterns is both important and practical.\n\nThe app in @fig-const-design is a tool that can help observers and political actors design a constitution for a given society. First, users can specify geographic, cultural, and economic conditions of a country, and they can also select which outcomes are the most important to them. The app then projects the optimal institutional design for these conditions. Users can edit this design to see how these adjustments will affect 10 different outcomes ranging from democracy and political stability to income inequality and standard of living.\n\nOne could fill books describing all the information packed into this app. Even then, written text does not do justice for the enormous amount of data available today. Interactive visualizations are much more efficient, engaging, and effective at communicating ideas. Just as American political institutions would benefit from being more dynamic, so too would the content produced by scholars of political institutions. Static content and constitutions hold back progress at a time when progress is imperative.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<style>\n  iframe {height: 750px; width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden; margin-top: 30px;}\n  @media (max-width: 843px) {iframe {height: 1320px}}\n  #fig-const-design {margin: 40px 0;}\n  .column-page-inset, iframe {margin-bottom: 0;}\n</style>\n```\n\n\n::: {#fig-const-design}\n::: column-page-inset\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://nmorse.shinyapps.io/const-design/\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n**The display above should take a moment to load. If it doesn't, [click here](https://nmorse.shinyapps.io/const-design/).** This app lets users configure a constitution on the left to maximize the outcomes in the graph on the right. By default, the app is configured to the United States Constitution. Users can pick whether to use linear regression or random forests for predictions. Linear regression produces less accurate predictions but it is easier to see how the bars move upon changing constitutional features. The plot on the second tab shows variance importance measures from the random forests, and the tooltip also displays coefficients from the linear regression models. Predictions are based on a sample of more than 600 constitutions since 1789, although some data were imputed with the MICE algorithm. All data are from the most recent version of the constitution. For example, the data for the US Constitution specifies that the upper house of the legislature is directly elected (even though the Senate was not directly elected until the 17th amendment) and democracy data for the US is as of 2021.\n:::\n\n## It's not 1787 anymore\n\nThe simple, uncomfortable truth about the Constitution is that it is not a particularly *good* constitution. It excels only at survival, to the point now where it sacrifices the rest of its objectives so it can survive longer. On those actual objectives, listed in the preamble, the Constitution performs more poorly than most similar countries' constitutions. It was innovative by 1700s standards, but the rest of the world has been making great strides in constitutional design over the last two centuries. Most countries have rewritten their constitutions within the last century, each time building on the lessons of the previous. Their political systems were based on scientific evidence of what works and what doesn't. The American political framework was based mainly on speculation since barely any evidence existed yet. Many of its prominent features are ineffective and counterproductive.\n\nOne of the most unpopular features of the Constitution is the Electoral College, but the document's problems go much deeper. The Electoral College has garnered more attention than most other flaws of the Constitution because it has a straightforward problem and a straightforward solution. The Electoral College weights certain votes more than others, which violates the most fundamental standard of elections: *one person, one vote*. The president is elected unequally, so of course the president serves unequally. \n\nIf we look a little deeper, we see that the Electoral College treats people unequally because its composition is based in part on the Senate, which treats people even more unequally. On average, a person from the bottom half of states by population has 5 times as much power through their senators as a person from the other half. A person from Vermont has 46 times as much power through their senators as a person from Texas. Equal representation of states means unequal representation of people. This has ripple effects throughout the government: all judges and top officials are appointed by presidents and confirmed by the Senate. Of the elected institutions in the federal government, the House is the only one that even attempts to treat each person equally, yet it is the least powerful. \n\nMost of the power in the government stems from elections that count people unequally, so most of the government serves unequally. Over time, any groups that happen to be overrepresented can skew policy in their favor, building up a snowball effect of increasingly unfair outcomes. People naturally use this advantage to gain more freedom for themselves at the expense of others' freedom. Society as a whole sees a net loss to freedom, simply because its Constitution does not treat each person equally. To make matters worse, the primary source of this inequality---the apportionment of the Senate---is the one feature of the Constitution that is prohibited from being amended unless every single state agrees to it.\n\nIn the United States, political inequality is built into the core of the system, codified in the Constitution. Not even economic inequality, or the economic system in general, is so strictly enforced. The Constitution is immortal, never to be questioned, never to fall. If a leader demanded the same treatment, we would rightfully label them a tyrant. If a leader imposed the same level of inequality, we would not stand for it. When a centuries-old document does these, we make excuses for it. This is precisely why a tyrannical system is even more sinister than a tyrannical leader. It's easier to have faith in a bad system than it is to have faith in a bad leader. It's easier to rationalize a tyranny of the dead than it is to rationalize a tyranny of the living.\n\nBy the end of Trump’s presidency, a pandora’s box of crises were unleashed: violence had been tearing through the country, people couldn’t even agree on who won an election, the Capitol was sieged by extremists, public confidence in the government was drying up, the president had lost the respect of the world, and hundreds of thousands of people were dying from an out-of-control pandemic that most other governments contained more effectively. The United States has been facing an oddly similar set of crises to what it faced in 1787—although 1787 didn’t have the widespread election disputes, the attempted coup, or the mismanaged pandemic.\n\nFurthermore, Trump’s rise to power was the culmination of a perfect storm of structural problems, each stemming from a poor constitution. If the Constitution had included incentives for more parties, Trump would not have been one of only two viable candidates in 2016. If the Electoral College followed a principle so simple as counting each person equally (which virtually every other presidential system follows), Trump would not have won. If the Constitution’s checks and balances actually worked, Trump would not have been able to maintain such a firm grip on power. Trump—and the chaos he brought—rose not in *spite* of the Constitution, but *because* of it. At the very least, an even marginally better constitution would have stopped him and numbed the recent wave of democratic erosion.\n\nThe founders made it clear what they would have done in a situation like this. They didn’t need death and destruction to realize their constitution was failing. They were proactive enough to build a better system before the old one fell. Many of them preferred to stick with the original constitution, but they ultimately decided that a good constitution is better than a permanent one. We could do even better now, building on centuries’ worth of data and experience.\n\nBut the mood is different these days. Americans only know how to point fingers at problems and cross their fingers for solutions. Courage has been replaced with complacency. The fear that a constitutional convention would make matters worse has overshadowed the uncomfortable truth that if we don’t even *try* to come together and agree on a better system, we may never see one.\n\nAmerican politics has become rife with injustice, indifference, incompetence, greed, elitism, corruption, and violence. Is this what a working constitution looks like? If so, what does *not* working look like? A dictator? Another deadly civil war? Anarchy? Being conquered by a foreign power? Americans hold the Constitution to a dangerously low bar. Anything short of the collapse of civilization is fine. What are we waiting for? *This* is the moment in history to reevaluate the foundation of our system. If it’s not, I’d hate to see what is. When the founders faced similar problems to the current ones, they had the sense to admit they were wrong. They had the courage to peacefully reconstruct their system before it descended into chaos. Do we?\n",
